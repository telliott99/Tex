This repo consists of a large number of ``.tex`` files that are meant to be typeset to pdf.  To do this, you will need a LaTeX installation of some kind.  I describe how I do it [here](https://github.com/telliott99/MyUnix/blob/master/software/latex.rst).

In addition, I have generated the pdfs as of today (Mar 6 2015), and placed a zip file in my Dropbox Public folder [here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3534458/pdfs.zip).

This is a work in progress.  I made these short writeups for my son when he was studying calculus.  I am quite happy with many of them, but some others need help.  When I get time I will work on them some more.
