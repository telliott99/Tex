I wanted more space for chapter numbers in the calculus book.
(> = 100 there was not enough).

I found 
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/7853/toc-text-numbers-alignment/7857#7857

suggests package tocloft
tocloft installed as below, requires stdclsdv

I grabbed these off the web

packages live in
/Users/telliott_admin/Library/texmf/tex/latex/local

in simpler times you would just drag *.sty there
must also update the database

texhash

--------

These days they use .ins files, 
from which you can generate .sty
so I did do

latex stdclsdv.ins

and follow the prompts to generate stdclsdv.sty.  
But...  one package wanted *.ins

The README says

Get both
stdclsdv.ins
stdclsdv.dtx

- run: latex stdclsdv.ins (which will generate stdclsdv.sty)
- run: latex stdclsdv.dtx
- run: makeindex -s gind.ist stdclsdv
- run: latex stdclsdv.dtx
- Print stdclsdv.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual 
- Move stdclsdv.sty to a location where LaTeX will find it.

And then at the end, I was getting a control sequence error
The docs

http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/tocloft/tocloft.pdf

said to use this command
\setlength{\cftXnumwidth}{3em}

but what it didn't say was to subtitute for X:
\setlength{\cftchapnumwidth}{3em}

For debugging use 
python /Users/telliott_admin/Tex/calculus_book/combine.py > full.tex 
and examine the console for error messages.

That works!

# I used finally, 2.5em
