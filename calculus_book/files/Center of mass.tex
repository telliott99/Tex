As you know, in single variable calculus we can interpret
\[ \int_a^b f(x) dx \]
as the area underneath the curve $y=f(x)$ between the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ (our limits).  In multi-variable calculus we compute the double integral over the same region as follows
\[ \int_{x=a}^{x=b} \int_{y=0}^{y=f(x)} dy \ dx =  \int_{x=a}^b y \bigg |_0^{f(x)}  \ dx = \int_a^b f(x) \ dx \]
To be more general, we'd just say that we compute the double integral over the region $R$
\[ \iint\limits_{R} dx \ dy  \]
with the understanding that we can compute the inner integral with respect to either $x$ or $y$, whichever is more convenient.
Another difference from the single-variable approach is that we can extend this approach by computing
\[ \iint\limits_{R} g(x,y) \ dx \ dy  \]
Suppose, for example, that $g(x,y)$ is a function that gives the density of a flat object for each coordinate $x,y$.  In this case we usually use the label $\rho (x,y)$.  This integral gives the total mass of the object:
\[ M = \iint\limits_{R} \rho (x,y) \ dx \ dy  \]
To find the center of mass we compute
\[ M_x = \iint\limits_{R} \rho (x,y)\  y \ dx \ dy  \]
\[ M_y = \iint\limits_{R} \rho (x,y) \ x \ dx \ dy \]
And then finally 
\[ \bar{x} = \frac{M_x}{M} \]
\[ \bar{y} = \frac{M_y}{M} \]

Let's do a simple example.  Suppose our region is a rectangle with the origin as one corner and the point $(1,2)$ as the opposite corner.  It's just a 2D box of width $1$ and height $2$.  And let's say our density function is $\rho (x,y) = xy$.  Then
\[ M = \iint\limits_{R} \rho (x,y) \ dx \ dy =  \int_{y=0}^{y=2} \int_{x=0}^{x=1} xy \ dx \ dy  \]
The inner integral is
\[ \frac{1}{2} x^2 y \ \bigg |_0^{1} = \frac{1}{2} y \]
and the rest is
\[ M = \int_{y=0}^{y=2} \frac{1}{2} y \ dy = \frac{1}{4} y^2 \  \bigg |_0^{2} = 1 \]
Now
\[ M_x =  \int_{y=0}^{y=2} \int_{x=0}^{x=1} xy^2 \ dx \ dy  \]
The inner integral is
\[ \frac{1}{2} x^2 y^2 \ \bigg |_0^{1} = \frac{1}{2} y^2 \]
and the rest is
\[ M_x  = \int_{y=0}^{y=2} \frac{1}{2} y^2 \ dy = \frac{1}{6} y^3 \  \bigg |_0^{2} = \frac{4}{3} \]
Last, $M_y$ can be done in the same order
\[ M_y =  \int_{y=0}^{y=2} \int_{x=0}^{x=1} x^2y \ dx \ dy  \]
The inner integral is
\[ \frac{1}{3} x^3 y \ \bigg |_0^{1} = \frac{1}{3} y \]
and the rest is
\[ M_y  = \int_{y=0}^{y=2} \frac{1}{3} y \ dy = \frac{1}{6} y^2 \  \bigg |_0^{2} = \frac{2}{3} \]
Thus our center of mass is at the point $2/3,4/3$.  If it had made our lives easier, either integral could be computed with respect to $y$ before $x$.
The answer makes sense.  The density increases as we go to the right and up, so the center of mass is offset from the geometric center in the same direction.
