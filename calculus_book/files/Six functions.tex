The most elementary trigonometric functions are sine and cosine. 

\subsection*{basic definitions}

The "unit circle" is a circle of radius $1$ with its center positioned at the origin of coordinates, the place where the $x$ and $y$ axes cross.  From the diagram you can see that any point $(x,y)$ on the unit circle can be described in radial coordinates as $(\cos \theta, \sin \theta)$.

\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.5] {sine_cosine.png} \end{center}
That is:
\[ x = \cos \theta \ \ \ \ y = \sin \theta \]
If the circle has radius $r$ then
\[ x = r \cos \theta  \ \ \ \  y = r \sin \theta \]

The tangent is
\[ \tan \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \]
In the diagram, all three right triangles are similar.

Thus, by similar triangles, the blue side has this relationship
\[ \frac{\text{blue side}}{1} = \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \]
which explains why it is labeled as it is.

\begin{quote}
The mathematicians of ancient India built on the Greek work to make major advances in trigonometry. They [used] the sine (sin) and cosine (cos) functions, which we still do today. Sines first appeared in the Surya Siddhanta, a series of Hindu astronomy texts from about the year 400, and were developed by Aryabhata in Aryabhatiya around 500. Similar ideas evolved independently in China.
\end{quote}

The other functions are the inverses of sine, cosine and tangent, namely:  cosecant, secant and cotangent.  The secant (inverse cosine) comes up, but the other two are not especially important in calculus.  However, they do come up in one context that we will look at, Archimedes determination of the value of $\pi$.  The crucial step in that approach will turn out to be the calculation of the cotangent of the half-angle $\theta/2$ given the values of cotangent and cosecant for angle $\theta$.

The main relationship or identity is derived from the Pythagorean theorem.  We had above that for a unit circle
\[ x = r \cos \theta  \ \ \ \  y = r \sin \theta \]
Since $x$ and $y$ are the sides of a right triangle whose hypotenuse is $r$
\[ x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \]
and for a unit circle
\[ \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \]
which is usually written
\[ \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \]
and transformed to
\[ 1 + \tan^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta \]

It is assumed you've studied trigonometry before.

We can easily determine the values for these functions for three special cases.  

The first is the angle $45$ degrees or $\pi/4$.  Draw an isosceles right triangle with sides of length $1$ (left panel).

\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {30_45_60.png} \end{center}

Then the hypotenuse has length $\sqrt{2}$ (from Pythagoras) and the values are
\[ \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} \]
\[ \tan \frac{\pi}{4} = 1 \]

For the other two, bisect an equilateral triangle and erase one half (right panel).  The smaller angle is $30$ degrees or $\pi/6$ and its complement is $60$ degrees or $\pi/3$.

The values are
\[ \sin \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = \cos \frac{\pi}{3} \]
\[ \cos \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sin \frac{\pi}{3} \]
\[ \tan \frac{\pi}{6} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Savov:

\begin{quote}The sine function represents a fundamental unit of vibration. The graph of $\sin(x)$ oscillates up and down and crosses the $x$-axis multiple times. The shape of the graph of $\sin(x)$ corresponds to the shape of a vibrating string.\end{quote}

\subsection*{visualization of all six functions}

Consider a unit circle.  Extend the radius with the angle $\theta$ and then draw the vertical and horizontal tangents to the circle $a$ and $b$.  

\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {sixfuncs1.png} \end{center}
The original triangle with sides $x,y,r$ is similar to the triangle with sides $r,a,OP$, and both are similar to the triangle with sides $b,r,OQ$.
\[ x,y,r \sim r,a,OP, \sim b,r,OQ \]
By similar $\triangle$
\[ \frac{a}{r} = \frac{y}{x} =  \tan \theta \]
But $r=1$ so 
\[ a = \tan \theta \]
If you imagine a point moving around the circle $a$ will get very large as $\theta \to \pi/2$, and in fact, approaches $\infty$ there (becomes undefined).

The segment $OP$ is (by similar $\triangle$) to $r$ as
\[ \frac{OP}{r} = \frac{r}{x} \]
\[ OP = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \sec \theta \]

The horizontal from the y-axis to Q is $b$.  Consider $\theta$ near the top of the figure.  By similar $\triangle$, the relations we had were
\[ r/b = y/x = \tan \theta  \]
since $r = 1$
\[ b = \frac{r}{\tan \theta} = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \cot \theta \]
Finally
\[ r/OQ = 1/OQ = \sin \theta \]
\[ OQ = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \csc \theta \]
