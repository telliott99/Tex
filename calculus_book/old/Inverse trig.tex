\label{sec:Inverse_trig}

Although we cover a lot of basic geometry and some physics in this book, the integrals are not generally too difficult.  We see $\int \cos^2 x$ a lot, and we will cover that \hyperref[sec: Cosine_squared]{\textbf{next}}.

\subsection*{Inverse sine}
This is our first of the inverse trigonometric functions (there are only two really important ones).
\[ t = \sin^{-1} x \]
Read this as $t$ is the arc sine of $x$.  (Or inverse sine).  More usefully,  we can say that $t$ is the angle whose sine is $x$.  This means the same thing, we have just solved the first equation for $x$:
\[ x = \sin t \]

We need to be careful about the interval on which we're working, since if we go too far we will duplicate values and thus, no longer have a \emph{function}.  You can see from the plot that the range of $t$ should be $[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$.

We can derive something useful from this with a trig substitution:

Basic trigonometry says that if
\[ x = \sin t \]
\[ t = \sin^{-1} x \]
then
\[ \cos t = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
so differentiating
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \sin t = \cos t = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
Inverting
\[ \frac{dt}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
The derivative of the arcsine is that.

Furthermore, integrating:
\[ \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \ dx \]
\[ = \int dt = t \]
\[ = \sin^{-1} x \]
and
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \sin^{-1} x =  \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
This integral arises in many problems.

Another derivation is to say 
\[ x = \sin t \]
\[ dx = \cos t \ dt \]
\[ dx = \cos t \ dt \]
so the integral is
\[ \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \ dx = \int \frac{1}{\cos t}  \cos t \ dt = t \]

The complementary angles of a right triangle add up to $\pi/2$, thus
\[ \sin^{-1} t + \cos^{-1} t = \pi/2 \]
Here's a picture of the two functions together.  It is not hard to believe they add up to a constant.

We prove that easily by differentiating:
\[ \sin^{-1} t + \cos^{-1} t = \pi/2 \]
\[ \frac{d}{dt} \sin^{-1} t + \frac{d}{dt}  \cos^{-1} t = 0 \]
\[ \frac{d}{dt} \sin^{-1} t = - \frac{d}{dt}  \cos^{-1} t \]
where we had
\[ \frac{d}{dt} \sin^{-1} t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
The inverse cosine isn't seen that much because its the very same problem as the inverse sine.  

\subsection*{inverse tangent}
However, the inverse tangent is important.  Let
\[ x = \tan t \]
\[ t = \tan^{-1} x \]

Differentiating the first equation
\[ \frac{dx}{dt} = \sec^2 t \]
If you haven't seen this before, try using the quotient rule on $\sin t / \cos t$.
Inverting
\[ \frac{dt}{dx} = \cos^2 t \]

Basic trigonometry will show that if
\[ x = \tan t \]
then the hypotenuse must be $\sqrt{1 + x^2}$ so
\[ \cos t = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + x^2}} \]
and then
\[ \frac{dt}{dx} = \cos^2 t = \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \]

Integrate
\[ \int dt = \int \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \ dx  \]
\[ t = \int \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \ dx  \]
But $t = \tan^{-1} x$ so
\[ \tan^{-1} x = \int \frac{1}{1 + x^2} \ dx  \]

We will show elsewhere that
\[ (1 + x^2) \cdot (1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6 + \dots) = 1 \]
You can check by multiplying it out.  Rearrange and integrate
\[    \int \frac{1}{1+x^2} \ dx =  \int 1 - x^2 + x^4 - x^6 + \dots \ dx \]
\[ = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7} + \dots \]
Combining with what's above
\[ \tan^{-1} x = x - \frac{x^3}{3} + \frac{x^5}{5} - \frac{x^7}{7} + \dots \]
The angle whose tangent is $1$ is $\pi/4$ so
\[ \frac{\pi}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \dots \]
The first of a number of series that yield $\pi$.
