\title{Newton shell theorem}

\Large
In the previous \hyperref[sec:Newton_point_mass]{\textbf{chapter}}, we showed the first derivation of Newton's famous result, that the mass of a spherical body behaves in terms of gravitational attraction as if it were concentrated at the center of the sphere.  

A longer discussion including several results from Strang and a different version of the "shell theorem" from wikipedia are in the \hyperref[sec:Newton]{\textbf{appendix}}.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.3] {newton_volume2.png} \end{center}

In this chapter, we will look at the derivation given in Morris Kline's book in Chapter 16.  The reason for doing it again is that his approach is easily extended to give the result that there is no net force for a test mass \emph{inside} a hollow shell, and we can also obtain the formula needed for the tunnel inside the earth problem given \hyperlink{Earth_tunnel}{\textbf{here}}.  

An overview of the different strategies is that our previous approach was to integrate over the whole volume using both $\phi$ and $\rho$ as variables.  Here, we work with a hollow shell, and also, integrate over $s$ as a variable.  In this approach $\rho$ is a constant.

I've adopted a standard notation which is basically a compromise among the authors I'm following here.  So when the graphics I've lifted from Kline don't match up, that is why.  We begin with this one:
\includegraphics [scale=0.45] {Kline_16_18.png}  \includegraphics [scale=0.3] {newton_volume2.png}

The idea is to consider not a whole sphere or ball but a hollow shell, and show that its mass acts like it is at the center $O$.  Then, adding up a bunch of concentric shells gives the main result.  

We consider a band or belt of the hollow shell, where each piece is at a constant distance from the centerline.  In our notation the radius of the belt (a perpendicular dropped from the point $Q$ to point $A$ in the left-hand panel) is $\rho \sin \phi$.

The circumference of the belt is $2 \pi \rho \sin \phi$, the width is $\rho \ d \phi$ and so the surface area is
\[ A = 2 \pi \rho \sin \phi \ \rho \ d \phi \]
Following Kline, rather than calculate the mass, we take $t$ as the thickness of the (very thin) belt and $\mu$ as the density.  (This difference is not important to the argument).

$dM = \mu \ dV$ so the mass of the belt is
\[ dM = \mu t \ 2 \pi \rho^2 \sin \phi \ d \phi \]
and the total force on the test mass is
\[  \frac{Gm \mu t}{s^2} \ 2 \pi \rho^2 \sin \phi \ d \phi \]
The last part of the initial setup is that the net force is that part which acts along the central axis.  $dF$ is really
\[ dF = \frac{Gm \mu t}{s^2} \ 2 \pi \rho^2 \sin \phi \ d \phi \cdot \cos \gamma \]

If we were following the wikipedia derivation we would now get everything in terms of $\phi$ and integrate over $\phi = [0, \pi]$, but Kline does something different.  He expresses all variables in terms of $s$ instead.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.3] {newton_volume2.png} \end{center}
Rather than go through the law of cosines (we would get the same result), we can almost read off the diagram, in the right triangle the side adjacent to $\phi$ is $\rho \cos \phi$, so the side adjacent to $\gamma$ is $D - \rho \cos \phi$ and
\[ \cos \gamma = \frac{D - \rho \cos \phi}{s} \]

This helps, but it's not all that we need.  We've exchanged $\gamma$ for $\phi$ and $s$, but what we need is all $s$ with no $\phi$.  From the law of cosines:
\[ s^2 = D^2 + \rho^2 - 2D \rho \cos \phi \]
Kline does a bit of clever algebraic manipulation.  Rearrange:
\[ s^2 - D^2 - \rho^2 = - 2D \rho \cos \phi \]
Add $2D^2$ to both sides
\[ s^2 + D^2 - \rho^2 = 2D^2 - 2D \rho \cos \phi \]
\[ \frac{s^2 + D^2 - \rho^2}{2D} = D - \rho \cos \phi \]
and thus
\[ \cos \gamma =  \frac{s^2 + D^2 - \rho^2}{2Ds} \]
The only variable is $s$, as we need.

Now rewrite the force as
\[ dF = \frac{Gm\mu t}{s^2} \ 2 \pi \rho^2 \ [ \ \frac{s^2 + D^2 - \rho^2}{2Ds} \ ] \ \sin \phi \ d \phi  \]

We still have $\sin \phi \ d \phi$.  We use this again:
\[ s^2 = D^2 + \rho^2 - 2D \rho \cos \phi \]
Carry out implicit differentiation --- $D$ and $\rho$ are constant!
\[ 2 s \ ds = - 2D \rho \ \sin \phi \ d \phi \]
\[ \sin \phi \ d \phi = \frac{s}{D \rho} \ ds \]
Back to the force
\[ dF = \frac{Gm \mu t}{s^2} \ 2 \pi \rho^2 \ [ \ \frac{s^2 + D^2 - \rho^2}{2Ds} \ ] \ \frac{s}{D \rho} \ ds \]

We are done with the fancy algebra.  Just cancel $2$, $s$ and $\rho$ top and bottom
\[ = \frac{Gm \mu t}{s^2} \ \pi \rho \ [ \ \frac{s^2 + D^2 - \rho^2}{D} \ ] \ \frac{1}{D} \ ds \]
Rearrange slightly
\[ = \frac{Gm \mu t \ \pi \rho}{D^2} \ [ \ \frac{s^2 + D^2 - \rho^2}{s^2} \ ] \ ds \]

This expression is what we have to integrate to get the total force.  Forget about the constant leading factor for a moment.  The integral is straightforward.  It breaks into two parts:
\[ \int \ [ \ 1 + \frac{D^2 - \rho^2}{s^2} \ ] \ ds \]
\[ = s - \frac{D^2  - \rho^2}{s} \]
\[ = s - \frac{(D + \rho)(D - \rho)}{s} \]
The interesting thing is the bounds on $s$.  The minimum value of $s$ is $D - \rho$ and the maximum value is the same except with the sign switched for the second term, so the bounds are $s = [D - \rho, D + \rho]$.

Hence, we obtain for the value of the integral
\[ s - \frac{(D + \rho)(D - \rho)}{s} \ \bigg |_{D - \rho}^{D + \rho} \]
At the upper bound we have
\[ (D + \rho) - (D - \rho) = 2 \rho \]
At the lower bound
\[ (D - \rho) - (D + \rho) = - 2 \rho \]
Subtracting the latter from the former gives simply $4 \rho$, so the force is
\[ F = \frac{Gm \mu t \ 4 \pi \rho^2}{D^2}  \]

Recall that for this problem we used $\mu$ as the density of the shell, thus its total mass is
\[ M = 4 \pi \rho^2 \ t \mu \]
and the force is just
\[ F = \frac{GmM}{D^2}  \]
The mass $M$ acts in gravitation as if it were concentrated at the center, a distance $D$ from the test mass $m$.

To finish the problem, we need to add up an infinite number of infinitely thin shells ranging over the entire radius of the solid ball.  For this purpose, we return to
\[ F = \frac{Gm \mu t \ 4 \pi \rho^2}{D^2}  \]
Recall that $t$ is the thickness of a thin shell.  In the limit, this thickness is $d \rho$ so we have for the entire ball
\[ F = \int_0^R \frac{Gm \mu \ 4 \pi \rho^2}{D^2}  \ d \rho \]
but this is just
\[ = \frac{Gm \mu}{D^2} \ V  \]
and $\mu \ V$ is the entire mass of the ball so
\[ F = \frac{GmM}{D^2}  \]

This is exactly as we had before.  It is nice to do things by a different approach and get the same answer.  However, we will now see another value of this method.  As promised, the test mass now moves inside the hollow sphere:

\includegraphics [scale=0.45] {Kline_16_22.png}  \includegraphics [scale=0.45] {Kline_16_23.png}

One change with the new setup is that $\phi$ may be obtuse when $P$ is inside.  That's OK, the law of cosines is still good even for an obtuse angle, which $\phi$ ($\theta$ in Kline's diagram), has become in Fig 16-23.

What is important and different is the \emph{bounds} on $s$.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {newton_volume3.png} \end{center}

Now $D < \rho$ (the radius of the shell) and the bounds on $s$ have changed as well.

When $s$ extends to the very top on the same side of the shell where the point $P$ is located, $s + D = \rho$ so
\[s = \rho - D \]
while on the very bottom of the other side $s = \rho + D$.
\[ s = [\rho - D,\rho  + D] \]

We evaluate the integral:
\[ s - \frac{(D + \rho)(D - \rho)}{s} \ \bigg |_{\rho - D}^{\rho + D} \]
At the upper bound, we get
\[ (\rho + D) - \frac{(D + \rho)(D - \rho)}{\rho + D} = 2 \rho \]
As before.  But at the lower bound
\[ (\rho - D) - \frac{(D + \rho)(D - \rho)}{\rho - D} \]
flip some signs
\[ = (\rho - D) + \frac{(D + \rho)(-D + \rho)}{\rho - D} \]
Canceling top and bottom
\[ (\rho - D) + (D + \rho) = 2 \rho \]

\emph{Subtracting} the latter from the former, we end up with zero.
There is no net force within the hollow sphere.

Now consider a solid ball, like the earth, and move inside as in the tunnel problem.

Imagine dividing the problem into two parts, break the ball into an outer hollow sphere, and an inner solid ball.  
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.45] {Kline_16_25.png} \end{center}
The part outside the current location of the object exerts no net force.

The inner part exerts a force proportional to its mass, which is its relative volume times the total mass, over a distance which is smaller than initially.  If the distance penetrated is $h$, the effective mass is
\[  \frac{4/3 \pi h^3}{4/3 \pi R^3} M = \frac{h^3}{R^3} M \]
and the force is exerted over the new distance $h$ so we have
\[ F = Gm \  \frac{h^3}{R^3} M \ \frac{1}{h^2} = \frac{GmM}{R^2} \ \frac{h}{R} \]
as we said \hyperlink{Earth_tunnel}{\textbf{here}}.  A simple answer.
