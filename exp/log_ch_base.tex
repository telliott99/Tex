The formula for change of base is
\Large \[ log_a(x) = log_b(x)/log_b(a) \]
\large
The way I use to remember this is to say to myself that $log_a(x)$ and $log_b(x)$ are related somehow---that's what we want---so they are on opposite sides of the equation.  Then, there is a ratio with another log in the denominator, and \emph{that log must be to the same base as in the numerator}.
You can check it with easy bases like $2$ and $4$
\Large
\[ log_2(16) = 4 \]
\[ log_4(16) = 2 \]
\[ log_4(2) = 1/2 \]
\large 
so
\Large
\[ log_2(16) = log_4(16)/log_4(2) \]
\large
is correct.
Here is a simple derivation:
\Large
\[ x = b^y \]
\[ y = log_b(x) \]
\[ log_a(x) = log_a(b^y) = y \ log_a(b) = log_b(x) \ log_a(b) \]
\[ log_a(x) / log_a(b) = log_a(b) \]
