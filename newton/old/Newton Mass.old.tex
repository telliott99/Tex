\Large
Strang introduces a problem solved by Newton, which is the result that the mass of a sphere acts (gravitationally) as if it is a point mass at the center of the sphere.  Here is Strang's figure
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.75] {Strang_14_18.png} \end{center}

In the figure, we consider the gravitational force at the point $(0,0,D)$, which is at a distance $D$ to from the center of the sphere, placed at the origin.  

$\phi$ is the usual polar angle to a little element of volume $dV$, which is a distance $q$ from our point.  $\alpha$ is the angle between the radial vector and the vector from us to the element $dV$ (it is \emph{not} $90^\circ - \phi$).

As he explains, what we need is the average of $1/q$ over the whole volume (not the average $\bar{q}$), and this turns out to  be $1/D$.  Thus, the gravitational potential $f$ is \
\[ f = \iiint\limits_{\text{sphere}} \frac{1}{q} \ dV = \frac{V}{D} \]

Then Strang says that the gravitational force is the gradient of $f$, written $\nabla f$, and its $z$-component is
\[ f_z = -\frac{V}{D^2} = \iiint\limits_{\text{sphere}}  \ \frac{1}{q^2} \ \cos \alpha \ dV \]

What we want to do here is follow his work on the first integral and then see if we can figure out the second one, which he "leaves for us."

\subsection*{integral for the potential}
We will do this integral in the order $d\theta \ d\phi \ d\rho$, starting with $\theta$.  That is:
\[ \int_{\rho = 0}^{R} \int_{\phi = 0}^{\pi} \int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi} \frac{1}{q} \ \rho^2 \sin \phi \ d\theta \ d\phi \ d \rho \]

I'm assuming this is basically familiar.

The inside integral gives a factor of $2 \pi$, which we'll forget about for the moment and put back in at the end.  And we'll do the outside integral just before that.  

So we have to solve
\[ \int_{\phi = 0}^{\pi} \frac{1}{q} \ \rho^2 \sin \phi \ d\phi  \]

We need an expression for $q$.  
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.5] {Strang_14_18.png} \end{center}
By the law of cosines
\[ q^2 = D^2 + \rho^2 - 2 D \rho \cos \phi \]

This is probably a good place for a substitution!  Let
\[ u = q^2 \]
\[ = D^2 + \rho^2 - 2 D \rho \cos \phi  \]
and then
\[ du = 2 D \rho \ \sin \phi \ d \phi \]
\[ \frac{1}{2D} \ du =  \rho \sin \phi \ d \phi \]
\subsection*{substitution}

we have
\[ \int_{\phi = 0}^{\pi} \frac{1}{q} \ \rho^2 \sin \phi \ d\phi  \]
\[ = \frac{1}{2D}  \ \rho \int \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \ du\]
\[ =  \frac{\rho}{D}  \ \sqrt{u} \]
\[ =  \frac{\rho}{D}  \ \sqrt{D^2 + \rho^2 - 2 D \rho \cos \phi} \]

Leave aside the factor of $\rho/D$ for the moment.  We need to evaluate the $\sqrt{u}$ plugging in the value for $\cos \phi$ at the bounds.

These are
\[ \phi = 0 \rightarrow \pi \]
so
\[ \cos \phi \ \bigg |_0^{\pi} \]
This gives $1$ at the lower bound and $-1$ at the upper one.

Thus, with subtraction (evaluating at the upper bound and then subtracting the result for the lower bound)
\[ \sqrt{D^2 + \rho^2 + 2 D \rho} - \sqrt{D^2 + \rho^2 - 2 D \rho}  \]
we obtain two perfect squares
\[ \sqrt{(D + \rho)^2} - \sqrt{(D - \rho)^2}  \]
\[ (D + \rho) - (D - \rho) = 2 \rho \]

So, recalling the extra factor of $\rho/D$, the middle integral becomes simply
\[ = \frac{2 \rho^2}{D} \]
Remember the factor of $2 \pi$
\[ = \frac{4 \pi \rho^2}{D} \]

Then, the outer integral is
\[ \int_0^R \frac{4 \pi \rho^2}{D}  \ d\rho = \frac{4}{3} \frac{ \pi R^3}{D} = \frac{V}{D} \]
as we said.  The average value of the expression $1/q$ over the whole volume is equal to $1/D$.

\subsection*{integral for the force}
The second half of the problem is the force.  We want the component of it directed along the $z$-axis, so multiplying by factor of $\cos \alpha$.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.5] {Strang_14_18.png} \end{center}

Strang says to calculate
\[  \iiint\limits_{\text{sphere}} \frac{1}{q^2} \ \cos \alpha \ dV \]
and we should obtain
\[ \frac{\text{V}}{D^2} \]
The average value of $1/q^2$ together with that factor of $\cos \alpha$ somehow works out to be $1/D^2$.

The hint is to use the law of cosines again, both to deal with $\cos \alpha$ as well as $\sin \phi$.

We start with
\[ \rho^2 = D^2 + q^2 -2Dq \cos \alpha \]
so 
\[ \cos \alpha = \frac{1}{2Dq} (D^2 + q^2 -\rho^2) \]

and the integral is then
\[  \iiint\limits_{\text{sphere}} \frac{1}{q^2} \ \cos \alpha \  dV \]
\[  \frac{1}{2D}  \iiint\limits_{\text{sphere}} \frac{1}{q^2} \cdot \ \frac{D^2 + q^2 -\rho^2}{q}  \ dV \]
\[  = \frac{1}{2D}  \int_{\rho = 0}^{R} \int_{\phi = 0}^{\pi} \int_{\theta=0}^{2\pi} \frac{D^2 + q^2 -\rho^2}{q^3}  \ \rho^2 \ \sin \phi  \ d \phi \]

The inner integral with respect to $\theta$ will give $2 \pi$ as before (which we leave aside for now), and waiting to do the outer integral with respect to $\rho$, the middle integral is
\[ \frac{1}{2D} \int_{\phi = 0}^{\pi}  \frac{D^2 + q^2 -\rho^2}{q^3} \ \rho^2 \ \sin \phi \ d \phi \]

We need to deal with those $q$'s.  Let 
\[ u = q^2 = D^2 + \rho^2 - 2 D \rho \cos \phi \]
\[ du = 2 D \rho \ \sin \phi \ d \phi \]
(treating $\rho$ as fixed for this middle integral).
\[ \frac{1}{2D} \ du = \rho \sin \phi \ d \phi \]
We had
\[ \frac{1}{2D} \int_{\phi = 0}^{\pi}  \frac{D^2 + q^2 -\rho^2}{q^3} \ \rho^2 \ \sin \phi \ d \phi \]
which becomes
\[ \frac{1}{2D}  \int  \frac{D^2 + u -\rho^2}{u^{3/2}} \ \rho \ \frac{1}{2D} \ du \]
\[ = \frac{\rho}{4D^2}  \int  \frac{D^2 + u -\rho^2}{u^{3/2}} \  \ du \]
\[ = \frac{\rho}{4D^2} \ [ \ \int  \frac{D^2 -\rho^2}{u^{3/2}} \  \ du + \int  \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \ du \ ] \  \]
The integral isn't bad:
\[ = \frac{\rho}{4D^2} \ [ \ (D^2 - \rho^2) \frac{(-2)}{\sqrt{u}} + 2 \sqrt{u}   \ ] \]
Rather than reverse the substitution, recall the bounds
\[ \cos \phi \ \bigg |_0^{\pi} \]
which give $1$ at the lower bound and $-1$ at the upper one.

Recall 
\[ u = q^2 = D^2 + \rho^2 - 2 D \rho \cos \phi \]
Evaluating $\sqrt{u}$ at the upper bound we have
\[ \sqrt{D^2 + \rho^2 + 2 D \rho} \]
\[ = \sqrt{(D + \rho)^2} \]
\[ = D + \rho \]
and at the lower bound we have
\[ \sqrt{D^2 + \rho^2 - 2 D \rho} = D - \rho \]

Thus, for the whole expression at the upper bound we have
\[ \frac{\rho}{4D^2} \ [ \ (D^2 - \rho^2) \frac{(-2)}{D + \rho} + 2 (D + \rho) \ ] \]
\[ =  \frac{\rho}{4D^2} \ [ \ (-2)(D - \rho) + 2 (D + \rho) \ ] \]
\[ = \frac{\rho^2}{D^2} \]

And at the lower bound
\[ \frac{\rho}{4D^2} \ [ \ (D^2 - \rho^2) \frac{(-2)}{D - \rho} + 2 (D - \rho) \ ] \]
\[ = \frac{\rho}{4D^2} \ [ \ (-2)(D + \rho) + 2(D - \rho) \ ] \]
\[ = - \frac{\rho^2}{D^2} \]

Subtracting this from the value at the upper bound yields
\[ \frac{2 \rho^2}{D^2} \]

The outer integral is then just
\[ \int_0^R  \frac{2 \rho^2}{D^2}   d \rho \]
\[ = \frac{1}{D^2} \ 2 \int_0^R  \rho^2  d \rho \]
\[ = \frac{1}{D^2} \ \frac{2}{3} R^3 \]
multiply by the last factor of $2 \pi$ and we obtain
\[ = \frac{1}{D^2} \ \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \]
which is just the volume divided by $D^2$, as required.
