capacitor
two plates separated by an insulator
stores energy electrostatically
small amount of leakage current

characterized by capacitance
ration of electric charge to the voltage difference
Farad = 1 coulomb/volt

usage:  block direct current
allow AC current to pass
smooth output of power supplies
tune radio to particular frequency

Hydraulic analogy a membrane in a pipe with water
the water flows back and forth 
but never goes very far, this is like AC current
the "membrane" can stretch and allow back and forth movement
but no electrons pass across the capacitor

inductor is analogous but stores energy in a magnetic field
