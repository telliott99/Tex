continuous
a function f is continuous at c if
- f(c) is defined
- lim_x->c f(x) exists and = f(c)

differentiable
a function is differentiable at c
if exists
lim h -> 0 [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h

if diff, then continuous
and if not continuous then not diff

extreme value theorem
if f(x) is continuous on a closed interval
then f(x) has both a max and min in the interval

intermediate value theorem
if f is continuous on [a,b] 
and k is any number between f(a) and f(b)
then there is at least one number c in (a,b)
such that f(c) = k

mean value theorem
if f is continuous on [a,b]
and differentiable on (a,b)
then there exists a number c in (a,b)
such that
f'(c) = f(b) - f(a) / b - a

L'Hospital's Rule
if lim f(x)/g(x) is 0/0 or infty/infty
if lim f'(x)/g'(x) exists (g'(x) unequal to 0)
then
lim f(x)/g(x) = lim f'(x)/g'(x)

FTC-I
if f is continuous on an open interval I containing a
F(x) = int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)
for every x in the interval
then F'(x) = f(x)

FTC-II
if f is continuous on [a,b]
and if F' = f
then
int_a^b f(x) dx = F(a) - F(b)
