A man passes a police car at point $A$ doing 60 mph (the speed limit) and 4 minutes later passes another police car at point $B$, also doing 60 mph, yet the second officer writes him a ticket for speeding, justified by the mean value theorem.  The reason:  point $A$ and point $B$ are 5 miles apart, hence the average speed over this interval was 75 mph, and \emph{must at least have been equaled at some point}.

If $f$ is a "nice" function on the interval $(a,b)$ then there exists at least one point $c$ in that interval where

\[ f'(c) = \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b-a} \]

What does it take to be "nice"?  The function $f$ must be continuous over the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$.

The proof of the MVT relies on Rolle's Theorem, which is similar.  Rolle's Theorem says that for a "nice" $f$, if $f(a) = f(b)$, then there will exist at least one point $c$ in the interval $(a,b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.  The MVT proof basically turns Rolle's interval so that $a \ne b$.
