The fundamental result of calculus with respect to trigonometric functions depends on
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \ \frac{x}{\sin x} \]
The ratio of the angle to its sine as the angle gets very small.  Here is a simple proof that the ratio is equal to $1$.
\begin{center} \includegraphics [scale=0.4] {lim_x_over_sinx.png} \end{center}
Consider the triangle that lies entirely inside the circle.  Its base is $r \cos t$ and its height is $r \sin t$, so its area is
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot r \cos t \cdot r \sin t = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin t \cos t \]
Consider next the segment of the circle with angle $t$.  Its area is that fraction of $2 \pi$ times the total area
\[ A = \frac{t}{2 \pi} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} r^2 t \]
Finally, consider the dotted line.  By similar triangles its length is in the same ratio to $r$ (which is the base of that triangle), as sine is to cosine of the angle.  That is, its length is $r \tan t$ and so the area of the triangle is
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot r \cdot r \tan t =  \frac{1}{2} r^2 \ \frac{\sin t}{\cos t} \]
Since these areas get progressively larger
\[ \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin t \cos t < \frac{1}{2} r^2 t < \frac{1}{2} r^2 \ \frac{\sin t}{\cos t} \]
Now divide by $(1/2)r^2 \sin t$
\[ \cos t < \frac{t}{\sin t} < \frac{1}{\cos t} \]
Now, as $t \rightarrow 0$, both $\cos t$ and $1/\cos t$ also go to $1$.  Therefore the ratio gets squeezed, and it goes to $1$ as well.  Thus
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \ \frac{x}{\sin x} = 1 \]

There is another limit that also comes up in the basic derivations, but it turns out to be related to this one.  That limit is:
