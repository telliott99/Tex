Consider a unit circle with radius $r=1$ and $y/r = sin\ \theta$ and $x/r = cos\ \theta$.  Extend the radius with the angle $\theta$ and then draw the vertical connector $a$ and horizontal connector $b$.  The original triangle with sides $x,y,r$ is similar to the triangle with sides $r,a,OP$, and both are similar to the triangle with sides $b,r,OQ$.
\[ x,y,r \sim r,a,OP, \sim b,r,OQ \]
By similar $\triangle$
\[ a/r = y/x = tan \ \theta \]
But $r=1$ so 
\[ a = tan \ \theta \]
If you imagine a point moving around the circle $a$ will get very large as $\theta \to \pi/2$, and in fact, becomes $\infty$ there.
\vspace {2 mm}

\noindent The segment $OP$ is (by similar $\triangle$) to $a$ as
\[ OP/a = r/y = 1/y = 1/cos\ \theta = sec\ \theta \]

The horizontal from the y-axis to Q is $b$.  Consider $\theta$ near the top of the figure.  By similar $\triangle$, the relations we had were
\[ x,y,r \sim r,a,OP, \sim b,r,OQ \]
\[ r/b = y/x = tan \ \theta  \]
since $r = 1$
\[ b = r/tan \ \theta = 1/tan \ \theta = cot \ \theta \]
%\[ b/OQ = cos\  \theta \]
Finally
\[ r/OQ = 1/OQ = sin \ \theta \]
\[ OQ = 1/sin \ \theta = csc\ \theta \]

Note:  the above diagram has an error, sine and cosine are switched.  I have to find the original figure (or redraw) to change this.
