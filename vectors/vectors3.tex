One way of specifying a line in 3D-space is as the intersection of two planes.  Another way is by giving a vector and a point in space.  Let's look at these in turn.
\noindent
Suppose we have the following two planes:
\[ x + y - z = 7 \]
\[2x - 3y + z = 3 \]

Since the $x,y,z$ terms are not related by a multiplicative constant, the planes are not parallel, so they will meet in a line, and the solutions consist of all the points on the line.  Let's find one solution, at $x=0$.  Then
\[ y - z = 7 \]
\[-3y + z = 3 \]
Adding
\[-2y = 10 \]
\[y = -5 \]
\[z = y - 7 = -12 \]
Our solution $P_0=(0,-5,-12)$.
Now find a second solution, at $z = -3$
\[ x + y = 4 \]
\[ 2x - 3y = 6 \]
Solving
\[ x = 4 - y \]
\[ 2(4-y) -3y = 6 \]
\[ 8 - 5y = 6 \]
\[ y = \frac{2}{5} \]
\[ x = \frac{18}{5} \]
The second point is $P_1 = (18/5, 2/5, -3)$.
Now we have two points on the line.  Its equation is 
\[ L = P_0 + t(P_1 - P_0) \]
\[ L = (0,-5,-12) + t(\frac{18}{5}, \frac{27}{5}, 9)\]
We can re-scale the vector that multiplies $t$ to have integer components (or length $1$, or whatever we wish).  Why not multiply by $5/9$?
\[ L = (0,-5,-12) + t(2, 3, 5)\]
There is another way to do this problem that might be a little easier.  Consider that the equation of the first plane gives its normal vector $n_1$ as
\[ n_1 =\ <1,1,-1> \]
Similarly the normal vector to the second plane is $n_2$
\[ n_2 =\ <2,-3,1> \]
Now, the vector that is parallel to the line of intersection is orthogonal to both $n_1$ and $n_2$  (Do you see why?)  So we compute the cross-product:
\[ n_1 \times n_2 = 
\begin{vmatrix} 
  i  &  j  &  k \\ 
  1  &  1 & -1 \\
  2  &  -3 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]
\[ = -2i -3j -5k \]
Multiplying by $-1$ gives what we obtained above.
